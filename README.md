# pomodoro

Command line tool for tracking pomodoro performance

Type `pom --help` for usage.

Pomodoro allows you to track your performance in a simple, structured manner and saves your tracking data to `~/.pomodoro/data.json` so that you can edit your data manually any time the CLI tool falls short.

For now, it just tracks data but the idea is to add a couple of commands to produce statistics from that data.
